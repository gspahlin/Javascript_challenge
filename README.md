# Javascript_challenge

In this exercise I took a non-functional website, and used Javascript to program it to display "UFO sighting" data in a table, and update the table based on date. 
The Javascript file 'app.js' is the only component of the finished website that I wrote. The HTML, CSS and data file were supplied to me. The 'Early Commits' folder
has rough draft versions of the app that aren't fully functional. The file 'ufo.svg' is a visual enhancement that was supplied to me.
